- Adjust array size using an interactive slider.
- Multithreaded execution to keep the UI responsive.
- Displays sorting time and algorithm complexity.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pygame (`pip install pygame`)

## Installation
1. Install Pygame: `pip install pygame`
2. Run the program: `python sorting_visualizer.py`

## Usage
